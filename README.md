# Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
Movie reviews are an important way to measure a movie's performance. Providing a number/stars of a movie that can quantitatively suggest whether a movie is thriving or not. A series of movie reviews give us deeper qualitative insights into various aspects of the movie, meanwhile,  written reviews tell us about the film's strengths and weaknesses. An in-depth analysis of film reviews can inform whether the film generally satisfies audience expectations.

In this project, I will use three different types of deep neural networks: Densely Connected Neural Networks (Basic Neural Network), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), which is a variation of Recurrent Neural Networks.
